    "The Game of Life ... is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The 'game' is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced 'players', by creating patterns with particular properties." -- Excerpt from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life' target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

    The Conway Universe is composed of a two-dimensional grid of square cells each of which is either alive or dead. During each cylce cells interact with its eight neighbours determining its state in the next step of its evolution.  The rules governing its outcome are:
  </p>

  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>

  <p>
    The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

    This application is a platform for creating your own initial condition in the Conway Universe and observing its evolution.
